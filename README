This package includes three components:
1) A shared library for terminal functionality (libterm.so)
2) A curses-based terminal (cterm)
3) A qt-based terminal (qterm)

Building for linux:
-------------------
1) In the libterm directory, run 'make'. This will build libterm.so and cterm
in the libterm/obj directory. 
2) In the qterm directory, run 'qmake', then 'make'. This will build qterm in
the libterm/qterm directory

Building for playbook:
----------------------
1) In the libterm/lib directory, run 'make'. This will build libterm.so in the
libterm/lib/nto/arm/so.le.v7 directory
2) In the libterm/qt directory, run the qmake application that comes as part
of the Qt for playbook build.
3) In the same directory, run 'make qtermbb.bar'. This will build qtermbb.bar in
the libterm/qterm directory, which can be loaded to playbook.
Note: cterm is not supported on playbook
