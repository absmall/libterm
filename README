This package includes five components:
1) A shared library for terminal functionality (libterm.so)
2) A curses-based terminal (cterm)
3) A qt-based terminal (qterm)
4) A cascades-based terminal (cascades is a BB10 gui framework, this is incomplete)
5) A shared library that an application can link to in order to embed a terminal emulator.

Building for linux:
-------------------
1) mkdir obj
2) cd obj
3) Run 'cmake ..; make'. This will build libterm.so, cterm and qterm.

Building for playbook:
----------------------
1) mkdir obj.playbook
2) cd obj.playbook
3) set the QTDIR environment variable to be the location in which qmake is installed (the qmake executable should be present in $QTDIR/bin/qmake)
4) In the libterm directory, run 'cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../ntoarm.cmake ..; make'. This will build libterm.so, qterm, libqterm and qterm.bar

Linking to libqterm:
--------------------
To make use of libqterm, rename the main function from "main" to "_main" and
link to libqterm. That's all! This will make a command-line application
automatically show a Qt window that serves as a terminal emulator for the
application.
