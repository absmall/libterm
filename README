This package includes three components:
1) A shared library for terminal functionality (libterm.so)
2) A curses-based terminal (cterm)
3) A qt-based terminal (qterm)

Building for linux:
-------------------
1) In the libterm directory, run 'cmake .; make'. This will build libterm.so, cterm and qterm.

Building for playbook:
----------------------
1) In the libterm directory, run 'cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=ntoarm.cmake .; make'. This will build lib/libterm.so
2) In the libterm/qterm directory, run the qmake application that comes as part
of the Qt for playbook build as '/path/to/qt/qmake qtermbb.pro'.
3) In the same directory, run 'make qtermbb.bar'. This will build qtermbb.bar in
the libterm/qterm directory, which can be loaded to playbook.
Note: cterm is not supported on playbook
