This package includes three components:
1) A shared library for terminal functionality (libterm.so)
2) A curses-based terminal (cterm)
3) A qt-based terminal (qterm)

Building for linux:
-------------------
1) mkdir obj
2) cd obj
3) In the libterm directory, run 'cmake ..; make'. This will build libterm.so, cterm and qterm.

Building for playbook:
----------------------
1) mkdir obj.playbook
2) cd obj.playbook
3) set the QTDIR environment variable to be the location in which qmake is installed (the qmake executable should be present in $QTDIR/bin/qmake)
4) In the libterm directory, run 'cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../ntoarm.cmake ..; make'. This will build libterm.so, qterm and qterm.bar
Note: cterm is not supported on playbook
